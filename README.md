# Analyzing Traffic Accident Data
This repository contains code to analyze traffic accident data with the goal of identifying patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. The analysis aims to visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Kaggle and can be found here. It provides detailed information about traffic accidents in the United States, including factors such as location, weather conditions, road surface conditions, and more.

# Analysis
The analysis is performed using Python programming language and various libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. The code explores the dataset, cleans the data, and extracts relevant features for analysis. It then visualizes the data to identify patterns and insights related to accident occurrence, severity, and contributing factors.

# Tasks
Data Loading and Cleaning: Load the dataset and perform necessary data cleaning steps such as handling missing values and data type conversions.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct EDA to understand the distribution and characteristics of the data. Explore factors such as accident severity, time of day, weather conditions, road surface conditions, and more.
Visualization: Visualize the findings using plots and charts to identify accident hotspots and factors contributing to accidents.
Insights: Draw insights from the analysis to understand patterns and trends related to traffic accidents.
